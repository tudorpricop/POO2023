## Lab 1: C Recap and GitHub

This lab provides a recap of the C programming language and introduces GitHub. The exercises include working with strings, files, scanf, and learning to use GitHub for version control.

## Lab 2: Simple Classes and File Organization

This lab covers creating simple classes and organizing program files using headers and cpp files. The exercises include defining class member variables and methods, as well as implementing set and get methods.

## Lab 3: Methods and Method Overloading

This lab covers defining methods in a class and focuses on method overloading. The exercises include creating methods with variadic parameters, promoting and casting data types, and an exercise of a canvas class with basic draw methods.

## Lab 4: Class Constructors and Sorting Algorithms

This lab covers using class constructors to initialize class objects and implementing sorting algorithms. The exercises include implementing sorting algorithms with different parameters such as initialization list, random numbers, and variadic parameters.
